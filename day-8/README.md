Bit late on this one, playing around with Three.js, going to shift the focus 100% towards learning new stuff for the rest of codevember rather that going for anything creative. It's really tough being able to built something you can be proud of on a daily basis, especially if you only have a couple of hours to do so. Mad respect for those who can make it work.
